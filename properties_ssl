Below is a complete example of an Ansible role that is fully compatible with Ansible 2.6. It:

Recursively searches under the directory defined by {{ websphere_install_root }} for files named ssl.client.props.
Appends a block (only if not already present) at the end of each file.
Inserts a commented heading:
arduino
Copy
# websphere fixpack 8.5.5.27 custom properties
followed by the contents of a properties file located in the role’s properties folder (named was_fixpack.properties), which in this example contains:
ini
Copy
com.ibm.ssl=true
Role Directory Structure
css
Copy
my_wasfix_role/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
└── properties
    └── was_fixpack.properties
File Contents
1. defaults/main.yml
Define default variables such as the WebSphere installation root:

yaml
Copy
---
# defaults/main.yml
websphere_install_root: "/opt/IBM/WebSphere"
2. tasks/main.yml
This tasks file performs the following actions:

Uses the find module to search recursively for files named ssl.client.props under {{ websphere_install_root }}.
For each found file, uses the blockinfile module to append a custom properties block (if not already present) at the end of the file.
The block includes a commented heading followed by the contents of the local properties file.
Note: Although Ansible 2.6 supports the loop keyword, this example uses with_items to ensure maximum compatibility with similar syntax from earlier versions.

yaml

# tasks/main.yml

- name: Find all ssl.client.props files under websphere_install_root
  find:
    paths: "{{ websphere_install_root }}"
    patterns: "ssl.client.props"
  register: ssl_client_props_files

- name: Append custom wasfix properties block to ssl.client.props files if not already present
  blockinfile:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    marker: "# {mark} WASFIX PACK PROPERTIES"
    insertafter: EOF
    block: |
      # websphere fixpack 8.5.5.27 custom properties
      {{ lookup('file', 'properties/was_fixpack.properties') }}
  with_items: "{{ ssl_client_props_files.files }}"
  become: yes
3. properties/was_fixpack.properties
Create this file in the role’s properties directory with the following content:

ini
Copy
com.ibm.ssl=true
Explanation
Finding Files:
The first task uses the find module to search for all files named ssl.client.props under {{ websphere_install_root }} and registers the list in ssl_client_props_files.

Appending the Block:
The second task iterates over each file found and uses the blockinfile module to insert a block at the end of the file.

marker: The marker (# {mark} WASFIX PACK PROPERTIES) ensures that the block is only added once per file.
block: The block starts with the commented header (# websphere fixpack 8.5.5.27 custom properties) and then inserts the contents of was_fixpack.properties using the lookup function.
insertafter: EOF: This ensures that the block is appended at the very end of the file.
become: yes: Allows the task to run with elevated privileges if necessary.
When you include this role in your playbook, every ssl.client.props file found under your WebSphere installation root will be updated with the custom properties block—ensuring it is added only once.
