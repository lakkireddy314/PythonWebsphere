File: defaults/main.yml
This file defines all the key variables including the base repository path, the NFS (source) paths, remote (destination) paths, and boolean flags to control processing and actions.

# Base paths
repo: /base/path/to/repo

nfs_repo: "/install/BAW"
nfs_was_repo: "{{ repo }}/WAS/FP27"
nfs_baw_repo: "{{ repo }}/BAW/24.0.0.1"
nfs_was_supplements_repo: "{{ repo }}/WAS/WAS_SUPPLEMENTS/FP27"
nfs_ifixes_repo: "{{ repo }}/ifixes"

remote_repo: "/opt/wps8/cores/BAW/"

remote_was_supplements_repo: "{{ repo }}/WAS/WAS_SUPPLEMENTS/FP27"
remote_ifixes_repo: "{{ repo }}/ifixes"

# Control which repositories to process
process_nfs_repo: true
process_was_repo: true
process_baw_repo: true
process_was_supplements_repo: true
# If set to false, the ifixes repo will simply copy zip files instead of unzipping them.
process_ifixes_repo_unzip: false

# Control action mode: stage or remove installation files
stage_install_files: true
remove_install_files: false
Features & Explanations
Path Definitions:
These variables set the source (NFS) and destination (remote) paths. Changing the paths or overriding these values later is straightforward.

Control Variables:
Booleans such as process_nfs_repo and process_ifixes_repo_unzip allow you to toggle processing for each repository. Additionally, stage_install_files versus remove_install_files determines which set of tasks run.

File: tasks/main.yml
This file is the main entry point for the role. It conditionally includes the staging or removal tasks based on the flags defined in defaults.

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Stage install files
  include_tasks: staging.yml
  when: stage_install_files

- name: Remove staged install files
  include_tasks: removing.yml
  when: remove_install_files
Features & Explanations
Conditional Execution:
Only one set of tasks is run depending on the provided variables, making the role flexible and preventing unintended operations.
File: tasks/staging.yml
This file first ensures that all remote directories exist and are empty. Then it processes each NFS repository by finding zip files and unarchiving (or copying) them if files are present. Note the added conditions checking that file lists are defined and nonempty, ensuring idempotent behavior.

Features & Explanations
Directory Management:

Creation: The file module ensures directories are present (idempotently).
Cleanup: A shell command using find removes all contents inside each directory. The task’s change status is conditioned on whether any output is returned, so it won’t always report a change if directories are already empty.
File Processing:

Each repository uses the find module to locate zip files. A default empty list (default([])) is provided to avoid errors if no files are found.
Unarchive and copy tasks check that there are files to process before running.
Conditional Checks:
Additional when conditions guarantee that tasks run only if the corresponding control variable is true and the file list is nonempty.

Compatibility:
All modules and syntax are supported in Ansible 2.9.2.

File: tasks/removing.yml
This file removes the remote directories that were used for staging. The file module with state: absent is idempotent, ensuring directories (and their contents) are removed if they exist.

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Remove remote_repo directory and its contents
  file:
    path: "{{ remote_repo }}"
    state: absent

- name: Remove remote_was_repo directory and its contents
  file:
    path: "{{ remote_was_repo }}"
    state: absent

- name: Remove remote_baw_repo directory and its contents
  file:
    path: "{{ remote_baw_repo }}"
    state: absent

- name: Remove remote_was_supplements_repo directory and its contents
  file:
    path: "{{ remote_was_supplements_repo }}"
    state: absent

- name: Remove remote_ifixes_repo directory and its contents
  file:
    path: "{{ remote_ifixes_repo }}"
    state: absent
Features & Explanations
Clean Removal:
Using the file module with state: absent ensures that the directories are removed if they exist and does nothing if they are already absent.

Idempotency:
Running the removal tasks repeatedly won’t cause errors, making this portion fully idempotent.

Summary
This role is now updated to include:

Additional conditions (checking for nonempty file lists before processing),
An idempotent cleanup mechanism that only reports changes when files are actually deleted,
Full compatibility with Ansible 2.9.2.
Each section is clearly separated, and comments throughout explain the purpose of each task, making the role both robust and easy to maintain.
