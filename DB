Explanation
DBUpgrade Task:

The expect module runs the DBUpgrade script and automatically responds with y when prompted.
The output is registered in the variable dbupgrade_result.
Verification Task:

The assert module checks that the expected success message is in the script output.
If the check passes, the task notifies both the startdmgr and startnodeagent handlers.
If the check fails, the playbook will stop with the specified failure message.
Flushing Handlers:

The meta: flush_handlers task forces the immediate execution of all notified handlers.
The playbook waits until both handlers have completed before moving on to the next task.
Handlers Section:

The handlers are defined to start the dmgr and nodeagent processes. They run in the order they are defined in the handlers: section.
This playbook ensures that verification and the subsequent notification of handlers are tightly integrated, and the play will wait for both handlers to complete before proceeding.
