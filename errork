Below is an updated version of the removal tasks in both the WebServer and WebSphere backup processing files. In these snippets, we explicitly cast the calculated remove_count to an integer and then use it in the slice expression by enclosing it in parentheses. This ensures that the slice index is always an integer. Make sure that the when conditions prevent the task from running when there arenâ€™t more backups than the retention count.

In process_webserver_backup.yml
yaml
Copy
- name: Set remove_count for WebServer backups for {{ ws_src | basename }}
  set_fact:
    remove_count: "{{ (ws_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length | int) - (backup_retain | int) }}"
  when: ws_source_stat.stat.exists

- name: Remove old WebServer backups for {{ ws_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ (ws_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list)[:(remove_count | int)] }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: ws_source_stat.stat.exists and 
        (ws_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length | int) > (backup_retain | int) and 
        (remove_count | int) > 0
In process_websphere_backup.yml
yaml
Copy
- name: Set remove_count for WebSphere backups for {{ wsphere_src | basename }}
  set_fact:
    remove_count: "{{ (wsphere_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length | int) - (backup_retain | int) }}"
  when: wsphere_source_stat.stat.exists

- name: Remove old WebSphere backups for {{ wsphere_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ (wsphere_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list)[:(remove_count | int)] }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: wsphere_source_stat.stat.exists and 
        (wsphere_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length | int) > (backup_retain | int) and 
        (remove_count | int) > 0
Explanation & Features
Separate Calculation of remove_count:
We first calculate remove_count using a set_fact task. This computes the difference between the number of backup files (using a default empty list if none exist) and the desired backup_retain value. We cast both values to integers using the | int filter.

Explicit Integer Casting in Slice:
In the loop, we use:

jinja
Copy
(ws_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list)[:(remove_count | int)]
This ensures that the slice index is explicitly an integer.

When Condition Checks:
The removal task runs only if:

The source directory exists.
The number of existing backup files is greater than the retention count.
The computed remove_count is greater than zero.
These modifications should prevent the "slice indices must be integers" error by ensuring that the slicing always receives an integer value.
