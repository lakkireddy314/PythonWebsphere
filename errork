Below is an updated snippet for the backup removal tasks. In this revision, we first calculate the number of backups to remove using a separate set_fact task. This avoids embedding the arithmetic directly in the slice filter and ensures that if the computed value is less than or equal to zero the removal task is skipped. Apply similar changes in both WebServer and WebSphere backup files.

For example, in process_webserver_backup.yml, update the removal tasks as follows:

yaml
Copy
- name: Set remove_count for WebServer backups for {{ ws_src | basename }}
  set_fact:
    remove_count: "{{ (ws_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length) - backup_retain }}"
  when: ws_source_stat.stat.exists

- name: Remove old WebServer backups for {{ ws_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ ws_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list | slice(0, remove_count) }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: ws_source_stat.stat.exists and
        (ws_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length) > backup_retain and
        (remove_count | int) > 0
And similarly in process_websphere_backup.yml:

yaml
Copy
- name: Set remove_count for WebSphere backups for {{ wsphere_src | basename }}
  set_fact:
    remove_count: "{{ (wsphere_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length) - backup_retain }}"
  when: wsphere_source_stat.stat.exists

- name: Remove old WebSphere backups for {{ wsphere_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ wsphere_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list | slice(0, remove_count) }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: wsphere_source_stat.stat.exists and
        (wsphere_existing_backups.files | default([]) | length) > backup_retain and
        (remove_count | int) > 0
Explanation & Features
Separate Calculation of remove_count:
We use a set_fact task to calculate the number of backups to remove as:

ini
Copy
remove_count = (number of backup files) - backup_retain
This ensures that if there aren’t more files than the retention count, the variable will be ≤ 0.

Conditional Check:
The removal task is executed only when:

The source directory exists.
The number of backup files is greater than backup_retain.
remove_count is greater than zero.
Avoiding ZeroDivision/Modulo Errors:
By moving the arithmetic to a separate variable and checking that it’s positive before slicing, we avoid issues with the slice filter.

Apply these changes to both the WebServer and WebSphere backup removal tasks. This should resolve the ZeroDivisionError you are encountering.
