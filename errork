Below is an updated snippet for the removal task in the backup file that ensures a division‐or modulo‐by‑zero error won’t occur. In this example, we add an extra condition to check that the value of backup_retain is greater than zero before performing the slice. This prevents a scenario where backup_retain is zero (or not defined as a positive integer), which would cause the error.

For example, update the WebServer backup removal task in process_webserver_backup.yml as follows:

yaml
Copy
- name: Remove old WebServer backups for {{ ws_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ ws_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list | slice(0, ws_existing_backups.files | length - backup_retain) }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: ws_source_stat.stat.exists and (ws_existing_backups.files | length > backup_retain) and (backup_retain | int > 0)
Similarly, update the removal task in process_websphere_backup.yml:

yaml
Copy
- name: Remove old WebSphere backups for {{ wsphere_src | basename }} (retain {{ backup_retain }})
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  loop: "{{ wsphere_existing_backups.files | sort(attribute='mtime') | list | slice(0, wsphere_existing_backups.files | length - backup_retain) }}"
  loop_control:
    loop_var: item
  when: wsphere_source_stat.stat.exists and (wsphere_existing_backups.files | length > backup_retain) and (backup_retain | int > 0)
Explanation & Features
Conditional Check for Retention:
The additional condition and (backup_retain | int > 0) ensures that the task runs only when backup_retain is a positive integer. This avoids an attempt to perform a slice with a negative or zero value that might lead to division/modulo errors internally in Ansible’s filters.

Existing Conditions:
The task already checks if the source exists and if the number of existing backup files is greater than the retention count.

No Change to Other Logic:
The rest of the role remains unchanged. This update only affects the cleanup (removal) tasks to ensure robustness.

If you set backup_retain to 0 or leave it unset, the task won’t execute the removal action, preventing the error. Adjust backup_retain as needed to retain at least one backup, and the error should no longer occur.
