Below is an example of how you could define a workflow template that includes manual approval (a “pause” node) between environment transitions, plus sample job template definitions for each environment. In this example:

The workflow template is named IBM BAW Upgrade Workflow with Approval.
The upgrade flow proceeds through Dev, then Intg, then Perf, and finally the Unit sub‑environment (which is part of the Dev inventory).
At each transition between environments a manual approval node is inserted so that an operator can approve the change before proceeding.
Each job template is configured for its inventory and accepts extra variables (such as target_env and sub_env) so that the upgrade playbook can be tailored for that environment.
Below are sample YAML representations (conceptual examples, as AWX/Tower workflows are normally built via the UI).

                            extra_vars: '{"target_env": "dev", "sub_env": "unit"}'
Explanation (Workflow Template)
Nodes:
The first node launches the Dev upgrade job template with extra variables (target_env: "dev", sub_env: "dev").
On success, an approval node ("Approve move to Intg") is triggered. Only once an operator approves does the workflow proceed to the Intg upgrade node.
Similar approval nodes are inserted between Intg → Perf and Perf → Unit.
The Unit upgrade job uses a job template for the Dev inventory but with sub_env: "unit".
Sequential & Manual Control:
The manual approval nodes ensure that an operator has a chance to verify results before moving to the next environment.
Job Template for Dev: job_template_dev.yml
yaml

name: "BAW Upgrade Job Template - Dev"
description: "Upgrades IBM BAW in the Dev environment. The Dev inventory includes the primary Dev hosts."
inventory: "Dev Inventory"

ask_inventory_on_launch: false
ask_variables_on_launch: true
ask_credential_on_launch: false
extra_vars: |
  target_env: "dev"
  sub_env: "dev"
Explanation (Dev Job Template)
Inventory: Uses the Dev inventory.
Extra Variables: Sets target_env to "dev" and defaults sub_env to "dev". This tells the playbook to apply the Dev upgrade configuration.
Flexibility: The job template prompts for extra variables so that an operator can override defaults if needed.

ask_variables_on_launch: true
ask_credential_on_launch: false
extra_vars: |
  target_env: "intg"
  sub_env: "default"
Explanation (Intg Job Template)
Inventory: Uses the Intg inventory.
Extra Variables: Sets target_env to "intg". The playbook will use this value to determine the appropriate configuration for Intg.
Job Template for Perf: job_template_perf.yml
yaml

ask_variables_on_launch: true
ask_credential_on_launch: false
extra_vars: |
  target_env: "perf"
  sub_env: "default"
Explanation (Perf Job Template)
Inventory: Uses the Perf inventory.
Extra Variables: Sets target_env to "perf" so that the playbook applies the Perf upgrade configuration.
Job Template for Unit (Dev Sub-Environment): job_template_dev_unit.yml
yaml
Copy
---
name: "BAW Upgrade Job Template - Dev (Unit)"
description: >
  Upgrades IBM BAW in the Unit sub-environment which is part of the Dev inventory.
  Use this template to upgrade the Unit segment within the Dev environment.

ask_inventory_on_launch: false
ask_variables_on_launch: true
ask_credential_on_launch: false
extra_vars: |
  target_env: "dev"
  sub_env: "unit"
Explanation (Unit Job Template)
Inventory: Uses the same Dev inventory.
Extra Variables:
Sets target_env to "dev" and sub_env to "unit" to indicate that the Unit sub‑environment should be upgraded.
Summary of Features
Sequential Flow with Approval:
The workflow template forces the upgrade process to move from one environment to the next only after manual approval. This ensures that changes are verified before progressing.

Independent Job Templates:
Each environment (Dev, Intg, Perf, and Unit) has its own job template with its own inventory and configuration settings. This modularity makes it easy to update or troubleshoot one environment without affecting the others.

Extra Variables for Customization:
The job templates use extra variables (target_env and sub_env) to tailor the upgrade playbook to the correct environment and sub‑environment.

Clear Workflow Structure:
The YAML-based workflow template shows a clear chain: Dev → (approval) → Intg → (approval) → Perf → (approval) → Unit, providing full control and visibility into the upgrade process.

This setup provides a robust, modular, and controlled process for upgrading IBM BAW across multiple environments, with the added step of manual approval between environment transitions.






You said:
define how to approve for the workflow template
Reasoned for 5 seconds
In Ansible Tower/AWX, you implement manual approval by inserting an "approval" node in your workflow template. When the workflow reaches an approval node, it pauses and requires a user to manually approve the job before it proceeds to the next node. Here’s how it works and how you can define it:

How Manual Approval Works
Workflow Pause:
When the workflow reaches an approval node, Tower/AWX pauses the execution. The job’s status will be marked as "Awaiting Approval."

User Action:
An authorized user logs into the Tower/AWX UI, navigates to the workflow job, and sees the pending approval. The UI provides an "Approve" button.

Approval Decision:
The user clicks "Approve" (or "Deny" if configured to handle that), which then allows the workflow to proceed (or stop).

Proceeding:
Once approved, the workflow continues to the next node in the sequence.

Example in the Workflow Template
Below is an updated version of the workflow template (in YAML‑like pseudo‑format) with approval nodes defined between environment transitions:

yaml
Copy
---
name: "IBM BAW Upgrade Workflow with Approval"
description: >
  This workflow upgrades IBM BAW by sequentially running job templates
  for Dev, Intg, and Perf environments (with Unit as part of Dev).
  Manual approval is required between each environment transition.
organization: "Your Organization"
nodes:
  - node_type: "job"
    name: "Upgrade BAW - Dev"
    job_template: "BAW Upgrade Job Template - Dev"
    extra_vars: '{"target_env": "dev", "sub_env": "dev"}'
    success_nodes:
      - node_type: "approval"
        name: "Approve move to Intg"
        # In the Tower UI, this node will pause the workflow until an authorized user approves it.
        success_nodes:
          - node_type: "job"
            name: "Upgrade BAW - Intg"
            job_template: "BAW Upgrade Job Template - Intg"
            extra_vars: '{"target_env": "intg", "sub_env": "default"}'
            success_nodes:
              - node_type: "approval"
                name: "Approve move to Perf"
                success_nodes:
                  - node_type: "job"
                    name: "Upgrade BAW - Perf"
                    job_template: "BAW Upgrade Job Template - Perf"
                    extra_vars: '{"target_env": "perf", "sub_env": "default"}'
Explanation & Features
Approval Nodes:
The nodes with node_type: "approval" are built-in in Tower/AWX. When the workflow hits these nodes, the job pauses and displays an "Approve" button in the UI.

Manual Control:
Only an authorized user can click "Approve," ensuring that you have an opportunity to verify the upgrade in one environment before proceeding to the next.

Sequential Flow:
In the above example, after completing the Dev upgrade, the workflow pauses at the "Approve move to Intg" node. Once approved, it continues to the Intg upgrade job, and so on.

Error Handling:
You can also configure additional nodes or failure branches if an approval is denied, thereby stopping the workflow or triggering alternate actions.

By using approval nodes, you ensure that the upgrade process does not automatically proceed between environments without human oversight. This added control is useful in environments where change control and validation are critical.

This is how you define and implement manual approval within your workflow template in Tower/AWX.

how to make sure approval access is given to a set of people
Reasoned for 4 seconds
In Tower/AWX, approval is controlled by user roles and permissions. To ensure that only a designated set of people can approve workflow jobs, you can do the following:

Assign Specific Roles:
In AWX/Tower, only users with the appropriate roles (e.g. “System Administrator”, “Workflow Manager”, or a custom role with workflow approval privileges) can approve workflow jobs. You can create a team (or use an existing one) that has these roles, and then only add the designated users to that team.

Use Organization and Inventory Permissions:
Make sure that only approved users have access to the specific organization or inventory that contains the workflow. This way, the “Approve” button will only be available to those with sufficient permissions.

Configure Job Template Permissions:
You can restrict who can launch, view, and approve job templates by setting up roles (such as “Execute” or “Workflow Approval”) at the job template level.

By setting these permissions properly, only the designated users will see the “Approve” button on pending workflow nodes and be able to take action.
