Steps to Create the Role
Install the Venafi Machine Identity Collection (if not already installed):

bash
Copy
ansible-galaxy collection install venafi.machine_identity
Create the Role Directory Structure:

bash
Copy
mkdir -p roles/venafi_download_cert/{tasks,defaults}
Define Default Variables:
Create a defaults/main.yml file in the venafi_download_cert role directory to define default variables:

yaml
Copy
---
# Default variables for the venafi_download_cert role
cert_name: "example_cert"  # Name of the certificate to download
cert_directory: "/etc/ssl/certs"  # Directory to save the certificate
venafi_zone: "Default"  # Venafi zone where the certificate is located
venafi_access_token: "your_venafi_access_token"  # Venafi API access token
venafi_url: "https://your-venafi-instance.example.com"  # Venafi API URL
Create the Task File:
Create a tasks/main.yml file in the venafi_download_cert role directory with the following content:

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Ensure the certificate directory exists
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: "{{ cert_directory }}"
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'

- name: Download the certificate using Venafi Machine Identity
  venafi.machine_identity.certificate:
    zone: "{{ venafi_zone }}"
    certificate_name: "{{ cert_name }}"
    certificate_path: "{{ cert_directory }}/{{ cert_name }}.crt"
    privatekey_path: "{{ cert_directory }}/{{ cert_name }}.key"
    chain_path: "{{ cert_directory }}/{{ cert_name }}_chain.crt"
    access_token: "{{ venafi_access_token }}"
    url: "{{ venafi_url }}"
  register: cert_result

- name: Debug the certificate download result
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: cert_result
Create a Playbook to Use the Role:
Create a playbook (e.g., playbook.yml) to use the venafi_download_cert role:

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Download Certificate using Venafi Machine Identity
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: venafi_download_cert
      vars:
        cert_name: "my_certificate"  # Override default certificate name
        cert_directory: "/opt/certs"  # Override default directory
        venafi_zone: "My Venafi Zone"  # Override default Venafi zone
        venafi_access_token: "your_venafi_access_token"  # Override default token
        venafi_url: "https://your-venafi-instance.example.com"  # Override default URL
Run the Playbook:
Execute the playbook with the following command:

bash
Copy
ansible-playbook -i localhost, playbook.yml
Explanation of the Role
cert_name: The name of the certificate to download from Venafi.

cert_directory: The directory where the certificate, key, and chain files will be saved.

venafi_zone: The Venafi zone where the certificate is located.

venafi_access_token: The access token for authenticating with the Venafi API.

venafi_url: The URL of your Venafi instance.

The venafi.machine_identity.certificate module is used to:

Download the certificate (certificate_path).

Download the private key (privatekey_path).

Download the certificate chain (chain_path).

Example Output
When you run the playbook, the certificate, key, and chain files will be saved to the specified directory. For example:

/opt/certs/my_certificate.crt

/opt/certs/my_certificate.key

/opt/certs/my_certificate_chain.crt

The cert_result variable will contain the result of the certificate download operation, which can be useful for debugging.

Notes
Venafi Access Token:

Ensure the venafi_access_token has the necessary permissions to download the certificate.

You can generate an access token from your Venafi instance.

File Permissions:

Adjust the file permissions (mode) as needed for your environment.

Error Handling:

Add error handling tasks if the certificate download fails.

This role provides a reusable and modular way to download certificates from Venafi using the venafi.machine_identity collection in Ansible.
