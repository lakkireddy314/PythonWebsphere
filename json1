Below is an updated JSON example where the Inventory Limit survey question provides additional information (via its help_text) to explain what each dropdown option does. In AWX/Tower surveys, there isn’t a dedicated “info” field for a dropdown choice, so including the details in the help_text is the typical approach.

Explanation
Inventory Limit Question:

Choices: Each choice is defined as "Display Name|backend_value", so the user sees a friendly name (e.g. "Web Servers") while the backend value (e.g. "web*") is extracted in extra_vars using a split on the pipe character.
help_text: Provides additional information about what each selection does. When a user selects the dropdown, they can read this text to understand the effect of their choice.
Extra Variables Mapping:
The job template’s extra_vars line extracts the actual limit by splitting the selected string on the "|" character.

Boolean Questions:
The Enable Feature and Debug Mode questions are defined as radio buttons (multiplechoice with multiselect set to false) with options "True" and "False".

This configuration gives users clear guidance on the dropdown’s purpose by including additional info in the help_text, ensuring they understand what each option does.
