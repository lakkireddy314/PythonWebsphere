Below is an example Ansible role that calls the vcert CLI to enroll (i.e. request and download) a certificate from a Venafi TPP policy folder. In this example the certificate is output in PKCS#12 (PFX) format, and the private key within the PFX file is encrypted with the password “WebAS”. You’ll need to adjust the variables (such as the TPP URL, policy folder/zone, access token, common name, and output file path) for your environment.

A sample role structure might be:

css
Copy
Edit
venafi_cert/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
└── README.md
defaults/main.yml
Define your default variables. For example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
# defaults/main.yml
# Venafi Trust Protection Platform settings
venafi_tpp_url: "https://tpp.venafi.example/vedsdk"       # The URL for your TPP instance
venafi_policy_folder: "DevOps\\Certificates"              # Your policy folder (zone); note escaping if needed
venafi_access_token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"             # Your pre-generated access token

# Certificate request settings
certificate_common_name: "myserver.example.com"           # The CN to request
certificate_file: "/tmp/myserver_certificate.pfx"         # Local path to store the PFX file

# Output options
certificate_format: "pkcs12"                              # Use pkcs12 to get a PFX file
pfx_password: "WebAS"                                     # Password used to encrypt the private key in the PFX
tasks/main.yml
Use the Ansible command module to run the vcert CLI. The command shown below calls “vcert enroll” with the –format pkcs12 option and supplies the required parameters:

yaml
Copy
Edit
# tasks/main.yml
- name: "Enroll certificate from Venafi TPP in PKCS#12 format"
  command: >
    vcert enroll
    -u "{{ venafi_tpp_url }}"
    -t "{{ venafi_access_token }}"
    -z "{{ venafi_policy_folder }}"
    --cn "{{ certificate_common_name }}"
    --format "{{ certificate_format }}"
    --file "{{ certificate_file }}"
    --key-password "{{ pfx_password }}"
  register: vcert_enroll_result
  changed_when: "'Certificate issued' in vcert_enroll_result.stdout"

- name: "Display vcert enrollment output"
  debug:
    var: vcert_enroll_result.stdout
How It Works
Variables:
The defaults file specifies the TPP endpoint URL, the policy folder (often called “zone” in Venafi Cloud but here you supply the policy folder for TPP), the access token for authentication, the common name for the certificate request, and the desired output file (a .pfx file). The variable pfx_password is set to “WebAS”, which will be used by vcert to encrypt the private key within the PKCS#12 file.

Task Execution:
The task runs the vcert CLI enroll command with the following parameters:

-u sets the TPP URL.
-t supplies the access token.
-z specifies the policy folder.
--cn defines the common name for the certificate.
--format pkcs12 tells vcert to output the certificate in PKCS#12 format.
--file directs the output to a specific file path.
--key-password sets the password for encrypting the private key inside the PFX; here it is “WebAS”.
Idempotence & Debug:
The task registers the output so that you can inspect the vcert CLI result. You can tweak the “changed_when” condition to better match your output.

This role example provides a baseline that you can extend (for example, by adding error handling or dynamic token generation) to integrate certificate enrollment from Venafi TPP into your automation workflows.

Make sure that vcert is installed on your control node (for example, via pip install vcert), and that the user running the playbook has access to the specified file paths.
