Explanation
Block Section:

The command module runs the imcl install command.
The output is registered as upgrade_result.
The task is forced to fail if the return code is not zero (i.e. failed_when: upgrade_result.rc != 0).
Rescue Section:

If the upgrade command fails, the rescue block is executed.
A debug task prints the return code, stdout, and stderr so you can see the detailed error message (including the missing plug-in details).
Finally, the fail task marks the role as failed with a custom message.
This structure ensures that if the upgrade fails (e.g. due to missing required installation files), the error output is displayed and the role stops execution as expected.
