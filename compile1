Compiling the VCert CLI for AIX involves several steps, given that AIX isn't officially supported by VCert. Here's a general guide to assist you:

Set Up Your Go Environment:

Install Go: Ensure you have Go installed on your AIX system. You can download the appropriate version from the Go official website.
Configure Environment Variables: Set the GOPATH environment variable to your Go workspace directory.
Download VCert Source Code:

Use the following command to fetch the VCert source code:
swift
Copy
Edit
go get github.com/Venafi/vcert/v5
Alternatively, clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Venafi/vcert.git
Modify Build Scripts for AIX:

Since AIX isn't officially supported, you'll need to adjust the build scripts:
Create a Build Target: In the Makefile, add a target for AIX.
Set GOOS and GOARCH: Specify GOOS=aix and GOARCH=ppc64 to match AIX's architecture.
Handle Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with AIX. Some might require patches or replacements.
Compile the VCert CLI:

Run the build command:
go
Copy
Edit
make build
If make isn't available, use Go's build tool directly:
ini
Copy
Edit
GOOS=aix GOARCH=ppc64 go build -o vcert ./cmd/vcert
Testing and Validation:

After compilation, test the binary to ensure it functions correctly on AIX.
Address any runtime issues, which might involve debugging and further code adjustments.
Please note that compiling on AIX can present unique challenges due to its distinct environment and system libraries. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with AIX, and be prepared for potential troubleshooting during the build process.
