how to check xml module is available.
Reasoned for 6 seconds
You can verify whether the XML module is available by using the ansible-doc command. For example, run:

bash
Copy
ansible-doc xml
or list all modules and filter for "xml" with:

bash
Copy
ansible-doc -l | grep xml
If the XML module is installed and available, you’ll see its documentation. If nothing shows up, you may need to install it via the community.general collection (especially on older versions like Ansible 2.9.2):

bash
Copy
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
Then, reference it in your playbook as:

yaml
Copy
- name: Modify XML file using the xml module from community.general
  community.general.xml:
    path: /opt/websphere/Appserver/plugin-cfg.xml
    xpath: /config
    add_children:
      - tag: property
        attributes:
          name: customProp
          value: someValue
This approach lets you confirm module availability and use it accordingly.

add mutiple properties from properties file into plugin-cfg.xml
Reasoned for 11 seconds
Below is an example playbook for Ansible 2.9.2 that:

Reads a properties file containing lines of key=value pairs.
Converts those lines into a dictionary.
Builds a list of XML “property” elements from the dictionary.
Uses the xml module to add those property elements as children under the <config> element in the plugin-cfg.xml file.
Assume your properties file (e.g. /path/to/custom.properties) looks like this:

properties
Copy
customProp1=value1
customProp2=value2
customProp3=value3
Here’s the playbook:

yaml
Copy
- name: Add multiple properties from properties file into plugin-cfg.xml
  hosts: your_target_host
  become: yes
  vars:
    properties_file: /path/to/custom.properties
  tasks:
    - name: Read properties file content
      set_fact:
        custom_props_raw: "{{ lookup('file', properties_file) }}"

    - name: Convert properties file into a dictionary
      # This splits the file into lines, converts each "key=value" line into a two-item list,
      # and then uses dict() to convert the list into a dictionary.
      set_fact:
        custom_props: "{{ dict(custom_props_raw.splitlines() 
                          | map('regex_replace', '^(\\S+)=(.*)$', '\\1,\\2') 
                          | map('split', ',') ) }}"

    - name: Debug: show custom properties dictionary
      debug:
        var: custom_props

    - name: Initialize XML property list variable
      set_fact:
        custom_props_list: []

    - name: Build list of XML property elements
      set_fact:
        custom_props_list: "{{ custom_props_list + [ {'tag': 'property', 'attributes': {'name': item.key, 'value': item.value} } ] }}"
      loop: "{{ custom_props | dict2items }}"

    - name: Debug: show XML property list
      debug:
        var: custom_props_list

    - name: Add custom properties to plugin-cfg.xml under <config> element
      xml:
        path: /opt/websphere/Appserver/plugin-cfg.xml
        xpath: /config
        add_children: "{{ custom_props_list }}"
      # In Ansible 2.9.2, the module name is "xml:" (without ansible.builtin prefix)
      
    - name: Save configuration (if applicable)
      command: wsadmin -lang jython -c "AdminConfig.save()"
      # Note: In many environments, configuration changes are saved automatically.
Explanation
Read and Convert the Properties File:
The first task uses lookup('file', properties_file) to read the file content.
The next task splits the content into lines and uses a regex to replace each line from
key=value into a comma-separated string (e.g. "customProp1,value1"), then splits it
into a list (e.g. ['customProp1', 'value1']) and converts the list of lists into a dictionary.

Build XML Property Elements:
We initialize an empty list (custom_props_list) and loop over the dictionary (converted
to a list of items with dict2items). For each key/value pair, we append a dictionary
representing an XML element (with "tag": "property" and an "attributes" dict).

Modify the XML File:
The xml module then targets the file at /opt/websphere/Appserver/plugin-cfg.xml and uses
an XPath of /config to locate the parent element. It adds the children specified in
custom_props_list.

Save the Configuration:
If necessary, you can run a command (or use your wsadmin process) to save the changes.

Note:
– Adjust the XPath or attribute names if your environment expects a different structure.
– The wsadmin save step might not be needed if your configuration changes are committed automatically.
– Make sure the xml module is available in your Ansible 2.9.2 installation. If not, you might need to install the community.general collection and use it as community.general.xml.

This playbook should add all custom properties from your properties file into the <config> section of plugin-cfg.xml.
