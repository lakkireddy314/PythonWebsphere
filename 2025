Here is a revised and broader version of DO â€“ LEARN â€“ GROW points tailored for middleware engineers across a variety of technologiesâ€”WebSphere, JBoss, IHS, Tomcat, MQ, Ansible, SSL, performance tuning, automation, and DevOps alignment.

âœ… DO (What I Delivered / Executed)
Successfully managed middleware infrastructure across dev, test, perf, and prod environments, including WebSphere ND, JBoss EAP, Tomcat, MQ, and IHS.

Delivered seamless fix pack and security patch upgrades, minimizing downtime and ensuring rollback mechanisms were in place.

Automated routine administrative tasks (start/stop, log rotation, health checks) using Ansible and shell scripting, improving consistency and reducing manual errors.

Built and maintained secure, automated SSL certificate renewal processes, integrating with tools like Venafi, CyberArk, and internal PKI systems.

Developed custom monitoring and alerting scripts for middleware runtime status (heap, threads, connection pools), improving issue detection response time.

Implemented configuration standardization across environments through templated config files and controlled deployment mechanisms.

Participated in incident resolution and root cause analysis, ensuring service restoration SLAs and documenting known issues for future reference.

Supported cross-functional teams (development, QA, InfoSec) by enabling controlled access, log traceability, and deployment coordination.

ðŸ“˜ LEARN (What I Improved / Picked Up)
Deepened knowledge in application server internals, including JVM performance tuning, garbage collection diagnostics, and classloader isolation.

Enhanced understanding of load balancing and plugin architecture, especially IHS/Apache with WebSphere, including plugin-cfg.xml tuning and failover.

Learned new automation practices in Ansible Tower/AWX, including controller workflows, job templates, and dynamic inventories.

Built proficiency in middleware log analysis and troubleshooting techniques, including thread dumps, GC logs, and core dumps.

Gained experience integrating middleware health checks into CI/CD pipelines, supporting proactive deployment decisions.

Acquired hands-on experience with message queue platforms like IBM MQ or RabbitMQ for middleware integration patterns.

Understood principles of high availability, clustering, and failover configurations across distributed middleware components.

ðŸŒ± GROW (Future Goals / Focus Areas)
Develop advanced observability tooling using Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK for visualizing middleware metrics and logs in real-time.

Expand automation to include zero-downtime deployments, blue-green and rolling updates using Ansible or native container strategies.

Learn and implement containerized middleware solutions (WebSphere Liberty, JBoss on OpenShift/Kubernetes) to modernize deployments.

Build a shared middleware knowledge base with runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and architectural decision records for internal training.

Lead efforts to improve security compliance (TLS 1.3, JCE policies, cipher hardening, audit logging) and contribute to policy definition.

Mentor junior engineers in automation-first mindset, helping them build robust, reusable roles/playbooks/scripts.

Drive adoption of self-service tools for Dev teams, such as request-based job templates, standardized deploy/rollback workflows, and cert validators.

# Performance Review: Middleware Engineer

## âœ… DO (What I Delivered / Executed)

- Managed and supported middleware platforms including WebSphere ND, JBoss EAP, Tomcat, IBM MQ, and IBM HTTP Server across dev, test, perf, and prod environments.
- Performed fix pack and iFix upgrades for application servers and web servers with rollback planning, reducing downtime and risk.
- Automated recurring middleware tasks (start/stop sequences, log rotation, health checks) using Ansible, Bash, and Python scripts.
- Delivered secure certificate renewal workflows integrating Venafi, internal CA, and openssl/`keytool` validations.
- Created robust Ansible roles and Tower workflows for configuration deployments, cluster control, and maintenance operations.
- Developed environment-specific reports in HTML/CSV (e.g., certificate health, upgrade status, cluster inventory), formatted for email delivery.
- Collaborated with development and QA teams to provide platform access, troubleshoot deployments, and ensure high middleware uptime.
- Supported incident troubleshooting with GC/thread/core dump analysis and root cause documentation.

## ðŸ“˜ LEARN (What I Improved / Picked Up)

- Enhanced understanding of JVM internals: garbage collection tuning, heap sizing, thread management, and performance diagnostics.
- Learned advanced Ansible Tower/AWX concepts including controller workflows, survey-driven inputs, conditional task flow, and job result parsing.
- Improved ability to write reusable automation with Jinja2 templating, dynamic `set_fact`, robust `when` conditions, and delegated task logic.
- Gained experience in wsadmin Jython scripting for WebSphere: managing servers, keystores, endpoints, and cert validation tasks.
- Learned to troubleshoot load balancerâ€“plugin issues and tune `plugin-cfg.xml` for optimal routing and failover behavior.
- Developed familiarity with SSL/TLS hardening practices (cipher suites, certificate expiry validation, truststore cleanup).
- Built knowledge around middleware monitoring tools and log analytics (ELK, Splunk, Prometheus exporters).

---

## ðŸŒ± GROW (Future Goals / Focus Areas)

- Modernize middleware automation to support container-native platforms (e.g., WebSphere Liberty, OpenShift-based deployments).
- Build and deploy observability tooling for middleware using Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack to track JVM/app server metrics.
- Extend certificate automation with expiration alerts, mobile-friendly reports, and integration into alerting platforms like Teams/Slack.
- Introduce zero-downtime upgrade strategies using rolling updates, cluster draining, and blue-green deployments.
- Contribute to internal middleware documentation: upgrade guides, runbooks, troubleshooting flows, and platform capability matrices.
- Lead knowledge transfer sessions and mentoring for junior engineers to share automation and platform skills.
- Strengthen middleware security by aligning platform configs with CIS benchmarks, TLS 1.3 enforcement, and regular compliance audits.
